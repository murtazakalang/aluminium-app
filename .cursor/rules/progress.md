## Project Progress Update

### Module 0: Foundation & Setup (Project Initialization)

**Status: Completed**

**Key Tasks Completed:**

*   **Application Skeletons**:
    *   Backend: Node.js/Express application initialized.
    *   Frontend: Next.js application (App Router) skeleton set up (conceptual, no UI elements built yet).

*   **CI/CD**: Basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions for linting, testing, building) planned (conceptual).
*   **Backend Configuration**:
    *   Environment variable handling (`dotenv`).
    *   Database connection established using Mongoose.
    *   Basic error handling middleware implemented.

### Module 1: Tenant & Auth Management (Backend)

**Status: Completed & Cleaned**

**Key Tasks Completed:**

*   **Schema Definition**:
    *   `Company` Mongoose schema created.
    *   `User` Mongoose schema created (includes password hashing, comparison methods, invitation/reset token fields, and unique email index per company).
*   **Authentication Endpoints (`/api/auth`)**:
    *   Company & Admin Registration (`/register`): Creates a new `Company` and an initial 'Admin' `User`.
    *   User Login (`/login`): Authenticates users and issues JWT (stored in cookies).
    *   User Logout (`/logout`): Clears JWT cookie.
    *   Password Reset Flow (`/forgot-password`, `/reset-password/:token`): Includes token generation, (mock) email sending, and password update functionality.
*   **Company Profile Management (`/api/companies`)**:
    *   `GET /my`: Fetches the authenticated admin's company profile.
    *   `PUT /my`: Updates the authenticated admin's company profile.
*   **Staff Management (`/api/staff`)**:
    *   CRUD operations: List, create (manual), get specific, update, delete staff members.
    *   Invitation Flow (`/invite`): Generates an invitation token and simulates email sending for new staff.
    *   Status Management (`/:userId/status`): Allows activation/deactivation of staff accounts.
*   **Role Management (`/api/roles`)**:
    *   `GET /`: Provides a static list of available user roles (Admin, Manager, Staff).
*   **Core Middleware Implemented & Consolidated**:
    *   **Authentication**: Centralized to `authController.protect`. It verifies JWT (from Bearer token or cookie), handles user state (`isActive`), and injects `req.user` and `req.companyId` for multi-tenancy.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Centralized to `middleware/rbac.js`. Provides a flexible way to restrict endpoint access based on user roles.
    *   **Multi-Tenancy**: Enforced by `authController.protect` providing `req.companyId`, which is then used by controllers to scope database queries.

**Confirmation:**

*   All backend features for Module 1 as specified in the PRD and Development Task list are implemented.
*   Middleware for authentication (`authController.protect`) and RBAC (`middleware/rbac.js`) has been consolidated, removing redundancies and ensuring `req.user` and `req.companyId` are reliably set across all protected routes.

**Technologies/Patterns Used:**

*   Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
*   JWT for authentication (stored in HTTP-only cookies)
*   BCrypt.js for password hashing
*   Crypto module for token generation
*   RESTful API design
*   Middleware pattern for Auth, RBAC, and error handling
*   Multi-tenancy through `companyId` scoping in database queries.
*   Mock email sending for development.

### Module 4: Product & Formula Management (Backend)

**Status: ✅ Completed**

Key Tasks Completed:
- **Schema Definition**: `ProductType.js` schema implemented as per PRD, including `materials` sub-schema with fields for `materialId`, `formulas`, `formulaInputUnit`, `quantityUnit`, `isCutRequired`, and `defaultGauge`.
- **Controller & Routes (`productController.js`, `productRoutes.js`)**:
    - Implemented CRUD endpoints for Product Types (`/api/products`).
    - Added `POST /api/products/validate-formula` endpoint.
    - Added `POST /api/products/calculate-cost` endpoint for pre-optimization cost estimation.
- **Core Logic & Utilities**:
    - `formulaEvaluator.js`: Safely parses and evaluates material formulas (W, H variables) using `mathjs`.
    - `unitConverter.js`: Handles unit conversions critical for formula evaluation and cost calculation.
    - `processAndValidateMaterials` helper in `productController.js`: Validates material data, checks for `materialId` existence, and ensures `ProductType.materials.quantityUnit` matches `Material.usageUnit`.
- **Cost Calculation (`calculateProductCost` in `productController.js`)**:
    - Fetches `ProductType` and associated `Material` details.
    - Evaluates formulas for each material based on input dimensions (W,H) and `formulaInputUnit`.
    - Converts results to the `quantityUnit`.
    - For profiles, if `stockUnit` is weight, converts calculated length to weight using `gaugeSpecificWeights` via `convertProfileLengthToWeight` from `weightUtils.js`.
    - Calculates cost based on `materialTotalQuantityForRate` and `inventoryMaterial.unitRateForStockUnit`.
    - Returns a detailed breakdown and any errors.
- **Service Layer (`productService.js`) - Note: Some logic from PRD for productService.js seems to be implemented directly in productController.js based on provided files.** The `productController.js` handles the primary calculation logic.

## Backend Middleware & Route Protection Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization Middleware Guidelines

#### 1. Middleware Imports
- **Always import `protect` from `../controllers/authController`**
- **Always import `rbac` from `../middleware/rbac`**

#### 2. Route Protection Pattern
For each route file, follow this consistent pattern:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const controller = require('../controllers/exampleController');
const { protect } = require('../controllers/authController');
const rbac = require('../middleware/rbac');

// Protect all routes in this router
router.use(protect);

// Example routes with role-based access control
router.get('/', 
    rbac(['Admin', 'Manager', 'Staff']), 
    controller.getItems
);

router.post('/', 
    rbac(['Admin', 'Manager']), 
    controller.createItem
);
```

#### 3. Controller Implementation
- Remove middleware-related code from controllers
- Use `req.user` for company and user context
- Rely on `protect` middleware to set `req.user` and `req.companyId`

```javascript
// Example controller method
const getItems = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Use req.user.companyId for multi-tenancy
        const items = await Model.find({ 
            companyId: req.user.companyId 
        });
        res.status(200).json(items);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }
};
```

#### 4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Do not create separate `authMiddleware.js`
- Do not import `protect` from middleware files
- Always use `authController.protect`
- Consistently apply `rbac` middleware for role-based access

#### 5. Roles Hierarchy
Typical roles in order of increasing permissions:
1. Staff (Limited access)
2. Manager (Broader access)
3. Admin (Full access)

#### 6. Debugging Authentication Issues
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set in `.env`
- Check token generation during login
- Ensure frontend sends token correctly
- Use console logs in `protect` middleware during development

### Recommended Workflow for New Modules
1. Create routes file
2. Import `protect` from `authController`
3. Import `rbac` from `middleware/rbac`
4. Apply `router.use(protect)` 
5. Add `rbac()` to each route
6. Implement controller methods using `req.user`

**Remember**: Consistency is key in middleware implementation across all modules.
