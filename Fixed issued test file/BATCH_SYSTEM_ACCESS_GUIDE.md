## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### âœ… **FIXED: Duplicate Key Error**
The system now properly handles existing materials from your legacy system:
- Materials marked `(Legacy)` will be **automatically migrated** to the batch system
- No duplicate errors - the system intelligently handles migration
- Your existing data is preserved during migration

### If the system doesn't load:
1. **Check backend is running**: 
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check frontend is running**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check console for errors**: Press F12 in browser and check Console tab

### If API calls fail:
- Ensure you're logged in to the system
- Check that backend is responding at `http://localhost:8000`
- Verify the v2 API endpoints are available

### **Migration Process**
When you select an existing material:
- The system automatically migrates it to the new batch system
- Your first stock entry becomes the first batch
- All future entries for that material will be batch-tracked
- Legacy data is preserved and accessible
