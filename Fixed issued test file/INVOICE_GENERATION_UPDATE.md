# Invoice Generation Update - Support for Advance Payments

## üéØ Business Requirement Change
**Updated**: Invoice generation is now allowed from any order status (except Cancelled) to support advance payments and partial billing scenarios.

## ‚úÖ Changes Implemented

### Frontend Updates

#### 1. OrderTable Component (`src/components/orders/OrderTable.tsx`)
**Updated `canGenerateInvoice` function:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only Packed, Delivered, Completed
const eligibleStatuses = ['Packed', 'Delivered', 'Completed'];

// AFTER: All statuses except Cancelled
const eligibleStatuses = [
  'Pending',
  'Measurement Confirmed', 
  'Ready for Optimization',
  'Optimization Complete',
  'In Production',
  'Cutting',
  'Assembly',
  'QC',
  'Packed',
  'Delivered', 
  'Completed'
];
```

#### 2. OrderDetailView Component (`src/components/orders/OrderDetailView.tsx`)
**Updated `canGenerateInvoice` function:**
- Same logic as OrderTable - allows invoice generation for any order except Cancelled
- Supports advance payment collection scenarios

### Backend Updates

#### 1. Invoice Controller (`src/controllers/invoiceController.js`)
**Updated `createInvoiceFromOrder` function:**

**Status Validation:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only specific statuses allowed
const allowedStatuses = ['Delivered', 'Completed', 'Packed'];
if (!allowedStatuses.includes(order.status)) {
  return next(new AppError(`Order must be in one of these statuses...`));
}

// AFTER: Only Cancelled status forbidden
const forbiddenStatuses = ['Cancelled'];
if (forbiddenStatuses.includes(order.status)) {
  return next(new AppError(`Cannot create invoice for ${order.status} order`, 400));
}
```

**Multiple Invoices Support:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Prevented duplicate invoices
const existingInvoice = await Invoice.findOne({ orderId, companyId });
if (existingInvoice) {
  return next(new AppError('Invoice already exists for this order', 400));
}

// AFTER: Allows multiple invoices per order
// Note: Multiple invoices can be created for the same order to handle advance payments and partial billing
// We remove the restriction that prevents multiple invoices per order
```

## üìä Use Cases Now Supported

### Scenario 1: Advance Payment
1. Order placed ‚Üí Status: "Pending"
2. Generate invoice for 50% advance payment
3. Customer pays advance
4. Order proceeds to production
5. Generate final invoice for remaining 50%

### Scenario 2: Material + Labor Split
1. Order confirmed ‚Üí Status: "Measurement Confirmed"
2. Generate invoice for materials cost
3. Order moves to production
4. Generate separate invoice for labor charges

### Scenario 3: Milestone Billing
1. Large order ‚Üí Status: "In Production"
2. Generate invoice for Phase 1 (Design)
3. Status: "Cutting" ‚Üí Generate invoice for Phase 2 (Materials)
4. Status: "Assembly" ‚Üí Generate invoice for Phase 3 (Assembly)
5. Status: "Completed" ‚Üí Generate final invoice

## üîí Security & Validation

### Maintained Restrictions:
- ‚úÖ Role-based access (Admin/Manager only)
- ‚úÖ Cannot generate invoices for Cancelled orders
- ‚úÖ All existing payment validation rules
- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant data isolation
- ‚úÖ Audit trail for all invoice generation

### Business Logic:
- ‚úÖ Each invoice gets unique ID (INV-YYYY-NNN)
- ‚úÖ Order data snapshot preserved in each invoice
- ‚úÖ Payment tracking across multiple invoices
- ‚úÖ Status management for each invoice independently
